React Portfolio
====

# Description
This is a portfolio displaying a sample of my body of work utilizing React to create the pages and elements within.

----

# What's inside??
Constructed using React and the React-Router-Dom to link between pages, this project demonstrates the knowledge needed to create a nearly full-stack React app while also showing an expos√© of the other projects I have created. The portfolio displays projects I have worked on as well as ways to contact me and view my web-presence. My resume is on the hompepage as well, available for a direct download.

----

# Improvements
The projects page could be styled a bit more cleanly and also should be updated as new projects are developed.
